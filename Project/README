Final Project: MakerBot Simulator

usage: ./makerbot [gcode file]
i.e.) ./makerbot cube.gcode

This simulator reads Gcode, which is CNC code read by 3D printers, by slicing .obj file or STL file, and extrude materials onto the printing base.

I downloaded random STL files from Thingviese(www.thingiverse.com)and exported into .gcode format, using Sli3r, as 3D printer software does. (i.e. MakerBot's MakerWare, DimensionSST's Catalyst)

If you take any gcode as parameter to execute the simulator, it will read file and retrieve all X-,Y-,and Z-positions to let printing header and rotating bar move. (It will print the extra contuoring outline, name called rafts, since this is default Sli3r setting)

Or, you are able to get any gcode, you will be able to run the simulator with that file. I suggest you to take around 1000lines of that code, not to make segmentaation fault.


For instances, I included several gcode which has only 1/3parts of the entire code, otherwise it takes too long to read file, or cause segmentation fault because of out of memory.

You will see how it works by watching the video:
